### Introduction
Your project is to read in a series of fractions from a text file, which will have each line formatted as follows: “A/B”.  Both A and B are NOT NECESSARILY whole numbers.  A sample text file is listed below, and the purpose of your program is to read in one line at a time and build a Fraction object from A and B.  For each unique Fraction seen, your program will create a FractionCounter object used to track the number of occurrences of that specific fraction.  When all the input is consumed, your program will print out its ObjectList of unique FractionCounters, which should report the fraction and its count – see output below. Program must reduce fractions, as demonstrated in the output below.

Sample text file input:
6/3

7/3

6/3

2/1

Sample output:
2/1 has a count of 3

7/3 has a count of 1
