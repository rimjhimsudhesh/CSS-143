### Description
In this homework you will implement and compare a variety of sorting algorithms. Specifically, you will implement insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort. For
each of these techniques you will count the number of comparisons needed for their operation, and the provided driver file will also time their execution. 

The data you will be sorting is an ArrayList of String objects from a dictionary. You will need to support two sorting techniques for these words -

lexicographical (a.k.a. “alphabetical” or dictionary order) and by length (i.e. shorter words come first, with ties being broken by lexicographical ordering).
For instance, if the words to be sorted are “piano, flute, clarinet”, then their lexicographical ordering is:


- clarinet
- flute
- piano

And their length ordering is:

- flute
- piano
- clarinet
