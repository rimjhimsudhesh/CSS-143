### Introduction
Your project is to read in a series of fractions from a text file, which will have each line formatted as follows: “A/B”.  Both A and B are whole numbers.  A sample text file is listed below, and the purpose of your program is to read in each fraction and count the number of occurrences for the current fraction.  When all the input is consumed (or as the input is consumed), your program will print out its list of unique fraction and their corresponding count — see the output below.  (You may assume no blank lines or misleading characters.  You may also assume the fractions in the input file are "normal" for a positive fraction, i.e., no division by zero, negative values, both numerator and denominator are integers, etc.
