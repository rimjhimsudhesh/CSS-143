### Summary
In this assignment, weâ€™ll build three classes that will implement a List, a Stack, and a Queue using Nodes and references rather than arrays. The Stack and Queue will inherit from the List (a linked list) class, and so these subclasses will be rather short. Then, build a simple LinkedListException class that will be thrown in place of RuntimeExceptions whenever exceptional or error situations occur.
